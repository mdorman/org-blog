* TODO Automate mirroring the post into a directory heirarchy

  Starting from the permalink (at least in WordPress), you could
  easily construct a filename to save under, rooted under a directory
  you specify.  We could give the option for posting to automatically
  prompt to save the file in that spot as well.

* TODO Packaging for MELPA or whatever

  I don't use the Emacs packaging tools, so I don't really know what's
  involved.  I presume it's simple.

* TODO Make it so the tests only prompt for the test blog password once
  
  That's the only thing that annoys me about running the tests right now.

* TODO Autocompletion of categories or tags

  One thing I appreciated about org2blog (though it's implementation
  had some warts).

* TODO Convert to be compatible with the Org 8.0 exporter

  I have no idea what will be involved---our own sub-exporter of html?

* TODO More testing

  I really want this to be rock-solid, so testing some of the more
  perverse permutations of things would be nice, to make sure they
  work as intended.

* TODO More back-ends

  It's not that I love WordPress, really.  I would love to see other
  options supported---perhaps even static blogging options.  I think
  I've kept things sufficiently open to allow that.

* TODO More idiomatic, better code

  It's my first Emacs project, what do you expect?

* TODO A customize interface

  I don't use it myself, really, but it would be a very nice thing.
  I'm fairly certain that everything necessary could be done that way,
  so it would be mighty cool.

* TODO More automation for setup

  It should be possible, in theory, to be given the URL of a blog
  (true for WP, and I imagine for others) and have it autodiscover the
  posting interface, prompt for username and password, and retrieve
  whatever else it needs and then save it somewhere for the user to
  use.  Gets around the =:blog-id= sort of stuff, or even having to
  know about =xmlrpc.php=.
